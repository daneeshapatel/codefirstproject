        <h2>About</h2>
        Hello! My name is Daneesha and I have created this website for my end of course project with CodeFirstGirls. I am currently a Fashion Marketing and Branding student at Nottingham Trent University so I made this website to reflect my interest in the Fashion industry. 

        <h2>What is Fashion Week?</h2>
        Fashion week is a fashion industry event, which lasts approximately one week. It is where fashion designers, brands, or fashion houses display their latest designs in a runway show. Fashion Week occurs twice a year (A/W and S/S collections) in major fashion capitals.
    
        <h2>What happens at a Fashion Week?</h2>
        At Fashion Week designers showcase their clothing on multiple models who walk down a catwalk. The audience is typically seated during Fashion Week and are usually requird to dress according to a dress code. The audience can be offered transporation to the show, beverages and sometimes dinner after the show.
